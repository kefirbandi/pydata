There is a good reason it is called an \"array\". It doesn't mean that there is no support for the standard operations, but one needs to understand the logic to apply these correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a **vector**, for example. In mathematics, we talk about row-vectors and column-vectors, both being 1-dimensional structures. One can use the \"transpose\" operator to go back and forth between them. But looking closely at them, one can conclude that a row-vector and a column-vector is really a short-hand notation for a 1\\*m, and an m\\*1 matrix respectively. For this reason **numpy does not introduce a \"vector\" object**.\n",

For example, it supports conjugation, inverse (when invertible) and the multiplication operator is overloaded to perform the matrix multiplication.\n",
